# **About the Library Management System**
This **Library Management System** is a personal learning project built with **C# and WPF**, designed to manage a collection of books, authors, publishers, and categories. 
It supports **CRUD operations** for these entities, with plans to expand its functionality in future iterations.

## **Purpose & Learning Goals**
The project was developed as a hands-on way to:
* Learn **C# and database management** using **MS SQL (+ SqlDataAdapter & SqlCommand)**
* Apply **SOLID principles** and improve code structure
* Gain experience in **debugging and version control** (Git/GitHub)
* Receive feedback and **code reviews** from a senior .NET developer to refine best practices

## **Current Features**
* **CRUD operations** for books, authors, publishers, and categories
* **Layered architecture** using Models, Interfaces, Repositories, and Services
* **Database integration** with SQL Server

## **Future Plans**
* Implement a **loan management system**
* Add **user accounts** for different roles (e.g., librarian, regular user)
* Create a **dashboard** for library insights
* Generate **reports** (e.g., book inventory, overdue loans)
* Build a **REST API** so the WPF application acts as an admin tool, while an **ASP.NET MVC frontend** serves regular users and librarians

This project has been an important step in my learning journey, allowing me to apply my knowledge beyond tutorials and into real-world application development.
